  - Key customers: top 5 Customers by Sales
3. **Slicers**
  - Time aka Year, Month
  - Sales calculated by: Ordered date, Shipped date
  - Order status: Complete, Incomplete; in which Incomplete order is order with null Shipped date.
  - Month status: Complete, Incomplete; in which Incomplete month is month including incomplete order.
  - Other slicers based on the raw data: Product category, Customer Name, Employee Name, Shipping Company
